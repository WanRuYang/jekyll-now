My macaroon experiment:
1) Googled recipes 
2) Visualized proportion of primary ingredients
3) Compared direction and oven temperature of each recipe
4) Measure room temperature and humidity 
5) Performed experimental baking
6) Tested different recipe and record the effects of humidity 

In my second post, I will posted the complete directions and analysis result: 

#### Ingredients
- 1 egg white
- 35 g almond flour
- 70 g powdered sugar
- 15 g white sugar
- some cream cheese and preserved fruit for filling
